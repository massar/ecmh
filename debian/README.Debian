Easy Cast du Multi Hub for Debian
---------------------------------

Website: http://unfix.org/projects/ecmh/

This can be build by using the 'deb' target for make.
Which calls simply "debian/rules binary" ofcourse ;)

MLDv2 is disabled at the moment because I need
to do more interoperability tests first.

If you want to test it, download the source
debian package and set the ECMH_SUPPORT_MLDV2
define in the src/ecmh.h file.
