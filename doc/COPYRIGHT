This program was developed for SixXS (http://www.sixxs.net) to
enable the users of this white label IPv6 tunnel broker service
to use Multicast IPv6 and send and receive IPv6 Multicast adding
a new dimension and use to IPv6 usage, something we should have
when IPv6 will be natively available. Users can use this package
to enable their machine to do Multicast Routing and thus to
enable their own networks to do Multicast.
